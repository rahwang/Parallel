Project 1

This directory contains two implemnetations of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm,
- a serial (src/floyd_serial.c)
- a parallel (src/floyd_parallel.c)

Important functions are stored funcs.c

To run the serial, in the src directory, make then run './floyd_serial INPUTFILE'.
To run the parallel, in the src directory, make then run './floyd_parallel NUMTHREADS INPUTFILE'
To run the tests, in the tests directory, make then run './serial' and/or './parallel'
